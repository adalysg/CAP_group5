## Overview
Our project analyzed AirBnB housing data in order to predict pricing based off of features such as number of bedrooms, bathrooms, beds, and guests available. We utilized linear regression and random forest models and compared the performance to determine which was better suited for our data. We found that the random forest model was able to outperform the linear regression model.
